        <p class="info-text">At Moz we believe there is a better way to do marketing.
            A more valuable, less invasive way <br>where customers are earned rather than bought.
            We're obsessively passionate <br>about it, and our mission is to help people archive it.
            We focus on search engine <br>optimization (SEO). It's one of the least understood and least 
            transparent aspects of <br> great marketing and we see that as an opportunity.
            We're excited to simplify SEO <br>for everyone through out software, education, and <community.</p>

        <p class="card-name"> Our founding</p>
        <p class="card-text">Moz was founded by Rand Fishkin and Gillian Muessig in 2004. It was called <br> SEOmoz, 
           and started as a blog and an online community where some of the world's <br> first SEO experts shared
           their research and ideas. We launched the Beginner's <br> Guide to SEO and our first 
           Search Ranking Factors study, and that hub of industry <br> expertise transformed into 
           a small consulting firm and led us to create some of our <br> first SEO tools

       <p class="funding-text">After a glimpse of the demand, we shifted our focus from consulting to our
          <br> software, taking our first round of funding in 2007 to power the development of 
          <br> new tools and ideas. By 2009, we tallied our first 5,000 subscribers and codified our 
          <br> core values in the acronym TAGFEE, continuing to lead the industry with our educational content in an effort to demystify SEO (this is also when we started 
          <br>  filming Whiteboard Fridays!)
